    "A 3x2x1 Neural Network as 11 weights inlcluding the bias units' weights. We can representent the value of each weight as a binary string using the IEEE 754 format. Then a hypothesis would be represented as bit string containing 352 bits. That is, 11 concatenated 32 bit strings. As the size of any hypothesis of this type will have a fixed number of 352 bits. We can use the regular single-point, double point and uniform crossover techniques as well as single point mutation. However, single-point and double point crossover are likely to cover the exponent part of IEEE 754 representation, thus producing offsprings that are vastly different from their parents. To ensure that the hypothesis search converges, it is desirable to avoid performing cross over the exponent part of the 32 bit binary representation. For this reason, uniform cross over modified to ommit bits 30 through 23 of each 32 bit segment is chosen as the crossover operator.\n",
