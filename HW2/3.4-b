The decision tree learned in this case was one with the sky attribute at the root, and with sky value ending up as the yes leaf node
and the rainy value ends up with the N leaf node. This is equivalent to the following general boundary hypothesis from the version space in Figure 2.3: <Sunny,?,?,?,?,?>. This hypothesis will classify on Sunny sampels as positive
and all non-sunny samples as negative, the decision tree and version space from figure 2.3 therfore both output the same classification on this traning set.
