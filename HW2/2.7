There cannot be a maximally specific consistent hypothesis for classifying real numbers because the interval between any 2 real numbers is infinite. In the example of 4.5< x < 6.1, if x was 5 a more specific consistent hypothesis could be 4.0 < x < 6.0, and even more specific one could be 4.999 < x < 5.001. The hypothesis can be made infinitely more specific using real numbers. We can modify the hypothesis representation to converge to a maximally specific consistent hypothesis by fixing the decimal point precision of the natural numbers, or by using integers instead of natural numbers.
